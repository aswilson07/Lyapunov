	Abstract = {Numerical methods for the solution of initial value problems in ordinary differential equations made enormous progress during the 20th century for several reasons. The first reasons lie in the impetus that was given to the subject in the concluding years of the previous century by the seminal papers of Bashforth and Adams for linear multistep methods and Runge for Runge--Kutta methods. Other reasons, which of course apply to numerical analysis in general, are in the invention of electronic computers half way through the century and the needs in mathematical modelling of efficient numerical algorithms as an alternative to classical methods of applied mathematics. This survey paper follows many of the main strands in the developments of these methods, both for general problems, stiff systems, and for many of the special problem types that have been gaining in significance as the century draws to an end. },

@article{Taylor2016,
	Abstract = {We show that the exact worst-case performance of fixed-step first-order methods for unconstrained optimization of smooth (possibly strongly) convex functions can be obtained by solving convex programs. Finding the worst-case performance of a black-box first-order method is formulated as an optimization problem over a set of smooth (strongly) convex functions and initial conditions. We develop closed-form necessary and sufficient conditions for smooth (strongly) convex interpolation, which provide a finite representation for those functions. This allows us to reformulate the worst-case performance estimation problem as an equivalent finite dimension-independent semidefinite optimization problem, whose exact solution can be recovered up to numerical precision. Optimal solutions to this performance estimation problem provide both worst-case performance bounds and explicit functions matching them, as our smooth (strongly) convex interpolation procedure is constructive. Our works build on those of Drori and Teboulle (Math Program 145(1--2):451--482, 2014) who introduced and solved relaxations of the performance estimation problem for smooth convex functions. We apply our approach to different fixed-step first-order methods with several performance criteria, including objective function accuracy and gradient norm. We conjecture several numerically supported worst-case bounds on the performance of the fixed-step gradient, fast gradient and optimized gradient methods, both in the smooth convex and the smooth strongly convex cases, and deduce tight estimates of the optimal step size for the gradient method.},

	Abstract = {We introduce new optimized first-order methods for smooth unconstrained convex minimization. Drori and Teboulle (Math Program 145(1--2):451--482, 2014. doi:                  10.1007/s10107-013-0653-0                                  ) recently described a numerical method for computing the N-iteration optimal step coefficients in a class of first-order algorithms that includes gradient methods, heavy-ball methods (Polyak in USSR Comput Math Math Phys 4(5):1--17, 1964. doi:                  10.1016/0041-5553(64)90137-5                                  ), and Nesterov's fast gradient methods (Nesterov in Sov Math Dokl 27(2):372--376, 1983; Math Program 103(1):127--152, 2005. doi:                  10.1007/s10107-004-0552-5                                  ). However, the numerical method in Drori and Teboulle (2014) is computationally expensive for large N, and the corresponding numerically optimized first-order algorithm in Drori and Teboulle (2014) requires impractical memory and computation for large-scale optimization problems. In this paper, we propose optimized first-order algorithms that achieve a convergence bound that is two times smaller than for Nesterov's fast gradient methods; our bound is found analytically and refines the numerical bound in Drori and Teboulle (2014). Furthermore, the proposed optimized first-order methods have efficient forms that are remarkably similar to Nesterov's fast gradient methods.},

@article{Nesterov09,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present a new approach for constructing subgradient schemes for different types of nonsmooth problems with convex structure. Our methods are primal-dual since they are always able to generate a feasible approximation to the optimum of an appropriately formulated dual problem. Besides other advantages, this useful feature provides the methods with a reliable stopping criterion. The proposed schemes differ from the classical approaches (divergent series methods, mirror descent methods) by presence of two control sequences. The first sequence is responsible for aggregating the support functions in the dual space, and the second one establishes a dynamically updated scale between the primal and dual spaces. This additional flexibility allows to guarantee a boundedness of the sequence of primal test points even in the case of unbounded feasible set (however, we always assume the uniform boundedness of subgradients). We present the variants of subgradient schemes for nonsmooth convex minimization, minimax problems, saddle point problems, variational inequalities, and stochastic optimization. In all situations our methods are proved to be optimal from the view point of worst-case black-box lower complexity bounds.},

	Abstract = {Let M be an affine manifold with a flat affine connection D. A Riemannian metric g on M is said to be a Hessian metric if g has a local expression g = D2u. A manifold M provided with such a pair (D, g) is called a Hessian manifold. We first prove the convexity of a Hessian manifold. We give a Weitzenb{\"o}ck type formula for the Laplacian reflecting (D, g). As an application we characterize D-parallel vector fields, and obtain a structure theorem of a compact Hessian manifold which is an extension of Calabi's theorem. We also discuss the Albanese variety of a compact affine manifold. },

	Abstract = {Algorithms, perhaps together with Moore?s law, compose the engine of the information technology revolution, whereas complexity?the antithesis of algorithms?is one of the deepest realms of mathematical investigation. After introducing the basic concepts of algorithms and complexity, and the fundamental complexity classes P (polynomial time) and NP (nondeterministic polynomial time, or search problems), we discuss briefly the P vs. NP problem. We then focus on certain classes between P and NP which capture important phenomena in the social and life sciences, namely the Nash equlibrium and other equilibria in economics and game theory, and certain processes in population genetics and evolution. Finally, an algorithm known as multiplicative weights update (MWU) provides an algorithmic interpretation of the evolution of allele frequencies in a population under sex and weak selection. All three of these equivalences are rife with domain-specific implications: The concept of Nash equilibrium may be less universal?and therefore less compelling?than has been presumed; selection on gene interactions may entail the maintenance of genetic variation for longer periods than selection on single alleles predicts; whereas MWU can be shown to maximize, for each gene, a convex combination of the gene?s cumulative fitness in the population and the entropy of the allele distribution, an insight that may be pertinent to the maintenance of variation in evolution.},

@article{Chastain14,
	Abstract = {Even the most seasoned students of evolution, starting with Darwin himself, have occasionally expressed amazement that the mechanism of natural selection has produced the whole of Life as we see it around us. There is a computational way to articulate the same amazement: ?What algorithm could possibly achieve all this in a mere three and a half billion years?? In this paper we propose an answer: We demonstrate that in the regime of weak selection, the standard equations of population genetics describing natural selection in the presence of sex become identical to those of a repeated game between genes played according to multiplicative weight updates (MWUA), an algorithm known in computer science to be surprisingly powerful and versatile. MWUA maximizes a tradeoff between cumulative performance and entropy, which suggests a new view on the maintenance of diversity in evolution.},

	Abstract = {{Summary.  Model choice plays an increasingly important role in statistics. From a Bayesian perspective a crucial goal is to compute the marginal likelihood of the data for a given model. However, this is typically a difficult task since it amounts to integrating over all model parameters. The aim of the paper is to illustrate how this may be achieved by using ideas from thermodynamic integration or path sampling. We show how the marginal likelihood can be computed via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on modified posterior distributions for each model. This then allows Bayes factors or posterior model probabilities to be calculated. We show that this approach requires very little tuning and is straightforward to implement. The new method is illustrated in a variety of challenging statistical settings.}},
